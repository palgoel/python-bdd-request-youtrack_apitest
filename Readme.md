This project is for testing youtrack api.
Here through scripts the issue has been added based on the user's access. 
The credential is hard coded here. 
This instance of youtrack is created by me (free). (https://apitesting.myjetbrains.com/youtrack)
For your usage you can create new instance(if required) and add users.
